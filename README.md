# Emoji Matching Game
 
#### This timed interactive game has a set number of emojis on a split left/right side, but the catch is there is always an extra emoji on the left side. The user has to click on the extra emoji on the left to advance rounds. Each round the user gets through, the harder the game gets, i.e. more smiley faces are generated. 

#### When the user fails to locate the extra smiley face, the game ends with their score and time.

#### There is also a reset button to start a new game. 

#### Ways I would improve this game in the future: 
   - A scorekeeper that keeps track of the user's highest score/ best time
   - A timer pause/resume button
   - A timer that would automatically start on first click rather than page load
